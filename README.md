In this repository we collect new widgets and proposals for smartVISU (see github.com/martin-gleiss/smartvisu)
which are not automatically integrated in smartVISU releases but provide useful additional features and fancy stuff.
This may become a pool of ideas for usage in future smartVISU releases or stay just a collection of nice-to-have extensions.

Rules:
- there is a branch named "new" where everybody wishing to contribute can place pull requests or send new code inside the 
  forum knx-user-forum.de/smartvisu. Pull requests which do not harm any of the existing code will be accepted openly but the code and it's function will not be tested in detail.
  
- a branch called "master" contains tested widgets which are considered to be stable. The maintaining crew once in a while decides on the integration of code out of the branch "new"
