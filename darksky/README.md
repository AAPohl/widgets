## Darsky weather service for smartVISU

This update for the darksky weather service adds verbal wind directions to darksky instead of angle values. It is compatible with smartVISU v2.9.2 and can be used without changing the proven configuration parameters if you are already a registered darksky user and had been using darksky in earlier versions of smartVISU.
