The archives mainly contain widgets that have been developed on the basis of a certain smartVISU version and have been released in later versions of smartVISU. 
Users staying with older smartVISU versions can load these additional widgets from the corresponding folders (first two digits of the version string). These are tested for compatibility.

Using widgets from a folder NOT correspondig to the smartVISU version will result in errors since the versions are not compatible.
